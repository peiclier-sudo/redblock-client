# Welcome to Redblock

**Redblock** is a modern 3D FPS aim trainer built with **Three.js**, **React**, and **TypeScript**. It features a powerful visual editor, advanced physics simulation, and a comprehensive audio system.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Visual Editor**: Drag-and-drop scenario builder with real-time preview
- **Target Generators**: Create dynamic target spawning systems with events
- **Physics Engine**: Rapier-based physics with collision detection
- **Audio System**: Multi-channel audio with spatial sound and music management
- **Performance Optimized**: Object pooling, spatial partitioning, and efficient rendering
- **Multiplayer Ready**: WebSocket-based multiplayer support


## 🎮 Default FPS Controls

Redblock now starts with an **AZERTY-friendly layout** and tuned movement for faster arena traversal:

- **Move forward**: `Z`
- **Move left**: `Q`
- **Move backward**: `S`
- **Move right**: `D`
- **Jump**: `Space`
- **Crouch**: `C`

You can still remap every key from the in-game **Settings → Controls** tab.
